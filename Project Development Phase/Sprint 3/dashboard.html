        <h1>ABOUT</h1>
      <p>Due to the ignorance of healthy food habits, obesity rates are increasing at an alarming speed, and this is reflective of the risks to peopleâ€™s health. People need to control their daily calorie intake by eating healthier foods, which is the most basic method to avoid obesity. However, although food packaging comes with nutrition (and calorie) labels, its' still not very convenient for people to refer to App-based nutrient dashboard systems which can analyze real-time images of a meal and analyze it for nutritional content which can be very handy and improves the dietary habits, and therefore, helps in maintaining a healthy lifestyle.

        This project aims at building a web App that automatically estimates food attributes such as ingredients and nutritional value by classifying the input image of food.
        Nutritional support is the provision of adequate nutrients to maintain a
              healthy body weight and avoid malnutrition. The continuous delivery of
              high-quality and cost-effective nutritional care to patients has been
              shown to be an increasingly difficult task.It is observed that dieticians
              are requested to carry out the nutritional assessment, to manually
              calculate the nutritional needs and to design the everyday meal plan for
              each patient. In most cases, these time-consuming tasks are not completed
              due to lack of time or inadequate number of personnel. Development of a
              computer assisted information tool with cloud-based on-line diet
              consultation module and comparison of its efficacy with one- to-one
              counselling would be efficiently utilized for client education intervention
              programs. The nutrient content calculation was planned to undertake with
              commonly consumed traditional as well as junk foods</p>
